About BSC Comorbidities browser
=========================

The original goal of this project is creating the BSC Comorbidities browser frontend

* Before running the BSC Comorbidities browser, please follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), and follow all the procedures referenced by [../REST/README.md](../REST/README.md).

* Once all the componens are properly installed, both the frontend and the API can be reached at http://localhost:5000 when the API is run in debug mode using the next command line:

```bash
cd ../REST
source .pyRESTenv/bin/activate
python como_network.py
```

  If you open http://localhost:5000 , you can start using the frontend.
