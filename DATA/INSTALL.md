# Install instructions of Disease PERCEPTION database population program

This program is written for Python 3.5 or later. It depends on standard libreries, plus the ones declared in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

* In order to install the dependencies you need `pip` and `venv` Python modules.
	- `pip` is available in many Linux distributions (Ubuntu package `python-pip`, CentOS EPEL package `python-pip`), and also as [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) Python package.
	- `venv` is also available in many Linux distributions (Ubuntu package `python3-venv`). In some of these distributions `venv` is integrated into the Python 3.5 (or later) installation.

* The creation of a virtual environment and installation of the dependencies in that environment is done running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .pyDBenv
source .pyDBenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
deactivate
```
